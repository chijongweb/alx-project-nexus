# ALX Project Nexus 

This repository is a comprehensive documentation hub of key learnings, challenges, and best practices from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. It serves as a knowledge base for backend technologies and a collaboration guide for cross-functional teamwork with frontend developers.

---

##  Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Consolidate major learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.
- Document backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and implemented solutions.
- Serve as a valuable reference guide for current and future learners.
- Foster effective collaboration between frontend and backend learners.

##  Key Learnings

###  Key Technologies Covered

- **Python** – Core programming language for backend development.
- **Django** – Robust backend web framework.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – For building scalable RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL** – Flexible API query language.
- **PostgreSQL & MySQL** – Relational database systems used across multiple projects.
- **Docker** – For containerization and environment consistency.
- **CI/CD** – Automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions.
- **Celery + RabbitMQ** – Asynchronous task queue for handling background tasks.
- **Redis** – For caching and performance optimization.
- **Swagger / drf-yasg** – Auto-generated API documentation.
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaborative development.
- **Unit & Integration Testing** – Test-driven development with `pytest` and `unittest`.
- **Datadog** – Web infrastructure monitoring and performance visualization.
- **Rate Limiting & Security** – Using `ratelimit` and custom Django middleware.

---

###  Core Backend Concepts

- **Database Design** – Relational schema design, ER modeling, normalization.
- **Asynchronous Programming** – Improving performance using async views, tasks.
- **Caching Strategies** – Redis-based caching to improve speed and reduce load.
- **Message Queues** – Decoupling services with Celery + RabbitMQ.
- **System Design** – Building scalable, fault-tolerant backend systems.

##  Real-World Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                                | Solution Implemented                                           |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| API response latency                    | Implemented Redis caching for frequent endpoints               |
| Long-running tasks blocking requests    | Offloaded to Celery workers using RabbitMQ as the broker       |
| Manual deployment errors                | Set up GitHub Actions to automate test and deploy pipelines    |
| Coordinating with frontend developers   | Shared Swagger and GraphQL docs for seamless API consumption   |



##  Chosen Project: E-Commerce Backend

###  Project Overview

The **E-Commerce Backend** project simulates the development of a production-grade backend system that powers an online store. It manages product data, user authentication, and advanced API functionalities like filtering, sorting, and pagination.

###  Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Products, Categories, and User management (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - JWT-based secure user authentication.

- **API Capabilities**:
  - **Filtering & Sorting**: Products filtered by category or sorted by price.
  - **Pagination**: Paginated results for optimal user experience and performance.

- **Database Optimization**:
  - Relational database schema design.
  - Indexing and query optimization for faster response times.

- **Documentation**:
  - Swagger/OpenAPI used to generate and host API docs.

###  Implementation Workflow

```bash
feat: set up Django project with PostgreSQL
feat: implement JWT authentication for users
feat: add CRUD APIs for products and categories
feat: enable filtering, sorting, and pagination
perf: add indexing and query optimizations
docs: add Swagger documentation for API usage
